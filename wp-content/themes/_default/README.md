# Wordpress Default Theme

This is a very basic Wordpress theme I use as a starting point for developing custom websites with Wordpress.
It includes almost everything needed, see the conf-Folder for custom stuff such as an .htaccess-file and an
SQL-Dump to get started with some default (german) settings.

## Recommended Plugins

These are not included, but when creating Wordpress-Sites, I often use these plugins:

- [Theme Check](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/theme-check/) -- a plugin to check your theme for best practices and errors
- [Add Lightbox & Title](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/add-lightbox-title/download/) -- does exacly what it says, for use with the herein included colorbox
- [All in One SEO Pack](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/) -- SEO, nice page titles etc.
- [Antispam Bee](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/antispam-bee/) -- If you have problems with spam. Free Akismet, kinda.
- [Google XML Sitemaps](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/) -- a nice sitemap generator for SEO
- [Magic Fields 2](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/magic-fields-2/) or [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) -- For adding custom taxonomies, post types and fields
- [NextGEN Gallery](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) -- If you want custom galleries: use this
- [WP-Beautifier](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-beautifier/) -- For better code output
- [WP-PageNavi](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-pagenavi/) -- A better page navigation

You of course don't have to install those, but I really like these plugins.

## Notes

Download, unpack, click, done? Forget it. This is a collection of files I use to get a simple Wordpress-Installation up and running.
It is not really a default-template ready to use. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me -- Twitter: @nebelschwade
